            <p>
                Happy 17th Birthday, You are my love and everything. Happy Birthday!
                The very first day I met you, a light to my life came on that I needed but did not know existed. While, more plainly put- your kindness, the laughter you bring to my life and your constant support have made every day with you an adventure I would love explain but words just are not enough.
                I just love the way you make everything seem better when things are not. Your smile can light up the darkest day, and you bring a warmth to every special moment through your actions. Your strength, your grace, and the ability to light up everyone's life around you amaze me every single time.
